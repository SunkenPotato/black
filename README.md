## What is `Black` ?

Black is a 
* **simplistic**,
* `anonymous`, 
* low-profile \
theme. 


Designed with the afore mentioned values in mind, `black` strives to reduce \
clutter by removing anything unnecessary and improve readability by maximizing \
the contrasts between text and backgrounds. \
\
Using simple, globally tested fonts, such as **Inter**, or `Geist Mono` reduces strain \
on your eyes. \
\


## Why Black?
Black is a theme for the static-site generator hugo. (well, what is that supposed to mean?) \
Being extremely easy to use, hugo uses `Markdown` for text.

Markdown is extremely simple to use. Most services today with text input already have markdown, \
and you may not even notice it. \
Ever typed two (or one) asterisks (*) after one another to make your text bold? \
Well, \
\
That's markdown.

Black also has built-in shortcodes*, such as `{{</*spacer*/>}}` or `{{</*divider*/>}}`, both inspired \
by SwiftUI's `Spacer()` and `Divider()`


## Why did I make `Black`?
I've seen a lot of websites on the internet, I'm sure everybody has. \
But every now and then I see one that **really** impresses me. \
I found one of those, and it did just that. \
A month later, when I was planning on making a website, I thought about that one. I tried to find it again in my search history, but I didn't. \
So, because I liked it so much, I tried to remake it from memory. \
Maybe one day the original creator will reach out to me. Maybe not.

## Why <u>not</u> Black?
1. Black doesn't have full mobile support yet, meaning some things will glitch out, \
or not appear as you expect them to.
2. Black isn't a professional project. This is just one of my hobbies, so if you want new features, \
It might take a long time for them to be implemented. Or you'd have to implement them yourself.
